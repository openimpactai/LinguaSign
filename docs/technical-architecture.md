# LinguaSign System Architecture

This document outlines the planned architecture for the LinguaSign project. As the project is in its initial stages (May 2025), this architecture represents our vision and may evolve as development progresses.

## System Overview

LinguaSign is designed as a modular system with the following major components:

1. **Data Processing Pipeline**: Handles dataset downloading, preprocessing, and feature extraction
2. **Model Training Framework**: Manages training, evaluation, and hyperparameter tuning
3. **Inference Engine**: Performs real-time sign language recognition and translation
4. **API Layer**: Provides interfaces for external applications
5. **Frontend Applications**: User interfaces for different use cases

## Current Implementation Status

As of May 2025, we have implemented:

- Basic dataset downloading scripts for WLASL and PHOENIX-2014T
- Feature extraction using MediaPipe
- Initial model implementations (CNN+LSTM, MediaPipe+ML, and Transformer)
- Basic training pipeline

The following components are planned but not yet implemented:

- API Layer
- Frontend Applications
- Advanced inference optimizations
- Deployment configurations

## Data Processing Pipeline

The data processing pipeline is responsible for acquiring, preprocessing, and preparing sign language data for model training and evaluation.

### Components

- **Dataset Downloaders**: Scripts to download and set up datasets (WLASL, PHOENIX, etc.)
- **Video Processors**: Extract frames and perform basic video preprocessing
- **Feature Extractors**: Extract landmarks using MediaPipe or other techniques
- **Data Augmentation**: Generate additional training data through augmentation
- **Data Loaders**: Efficiently load processed data for training

### Processing Flow

1. Raw videos are downloaded from dataset sources
2. Videos are preprocessed (resizing, normalization, etc.)
3. Features are extracted (landmarks, optical flow, etc.)
4. Data is augmented to increase diversity
5. Processed data is organized for efficient training

## Model Training Framework

The model training framework provides a unified interface for training, evaluating, and fine-tuning different model architectures.

### Supported Architectures

1. **CNN+LSTM Hybrid**:
   - CNN component extracts spatial features from each frame
   - LSTM component captures temporal relationships across frames
   - Suitable for gesture classification tasks

2. **MediaPipe+ML**:
   - Uses MediaPipe to extract hand, face, and pose landmarks
   - Classical ML algorithms (SVM, Random Forest) for classification
   - Lightweight and efficient for deployment

3. **Transformer-based**:
   - Self-attention mechanisms capture long-range dependencies
   - Encoder-only architecture for recognition tasks
   - Encoder-decoder architecture for translation tasks

### Training Pipeline

1. Data preparation and batching
2. Model initialization
3. Training loop with validation
4. Hyperparameter optimization (optional)
5. Model evaluation
6. Model export

## Planned Inference Engine

The inference engine will handle real-time sign language recognition and translation using trained models.

### Planned Features

- **Real-time Processing**: Optimized for low-latency inference
- **Multi-model Support**: Can use different models based on use case requirements
- **Device Optimization**: Supports CPU/GPU acceleration
- **Confidence Scoring**: Provides confidence metrics for predictions

### Inference Flow

1. Input acquisition (video stream, uploaded video, etc.)
2. Feature extraction
3. Model inference
4. Post-processing and result formatting
5. Result delivery

## Planned API Layer

The API layer will provide a standardized interface for external applications to interact with LinguaSign.

### Planned API Endpoints

- `/api/v1/translate`: Translates sign language video to text
- `/api/v1/verify`: Verifies if a sign is performed correctly
- `/api/v1/learn`: Provides learning guidance for specific signs
- `/api/v1/models`: Manages available models and their configurations

### Integration Options

- **REST API**: For web and mobile applications
- **WebSocket**: For real-time applications
- **Python Library**: For direct integration into Python applications

## Planned Frontend Applications

LinguaSign will support multiple frontend applications tailored to different use cases.

### Web Application

- **Translation Interface**: Upload or record videos for translation
- **Learning Interface**: Interactive sign language learning
- **Admin Interface**: Model and system management

### Mobile Application (Future)

- **Real-time Translation**: Camera-based sign language recognition
- **Offline Mode**: Works without internet connection
- **Learning Mode**: Step-by-step tutorials and feedback

## Proposed Technology Stack

Our proposed technology stack consists of:

### Backend

- **Python**: Core programming language
- **PyTorch**: Deep learning framework
- **MediaPipe**: Hand and pose tracking
