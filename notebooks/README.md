# LinguaSign Notebooks

This directory contains Jupyter notebooks for data exploration, model experimentation, and visualization. These notebooks provide interactive examples and insights into the LinguaSign project.

## Contents

- **data_exploration.ipynb**: Explore sign language datasets and visualize landmarks
- **model_comparison.ipynb**: Compare different model architectures for sign language recognition
- **feature_extraction.ipynb**: Extract features from videos using MediaPipe
- **training_visualization.ipynb**: Visualize model training progress and results
- **inference_examples.ipynb**: Examples of using trained models for inference

## Getting Started

To run these notebooks:

1. Install Jupyter:
   ```bash
   pip install jupyter
   ```

2. Start Jupyter:
   ```bash
   jupyter notebook
   ```

3. Open any notebook from the browser interface.

## Guidelines for Contributing Notebooks

When adding new notebooks:

1. **Naming Convention**: Use clear, descriptive names with underscore separators (e.g., `data_exploration.ipynb`).

2. **Documentation**: Include markdown cells to explain the purpose of the notebook and each major step.

3. **Code Quality**: Write clean, well-commented code. Use functions for reusable code blocks.

4. **Output**: Include sample outputs where appropriate, but clear all large outputs before committing.

5. **Dependencies**: List all required packages at the beginning of the notebook.

6. **Update README**: Add new notebooks to this README file with a brief description.

## Using Notebooks for Development

These notebooks can be useful for:

- **Prototyping**: Test new ideas quickly before implementing them in the main codebase
- **Visualization**: Create visualizations to understand data and model behavior
- **Documentation**: Demonstrate how to use different components of the project
- **Analysis**: Analyze model performance and identify areas for improvement

## Best Practices

- Keep notebooks focused on a single task or analysis
- Restart and run all cells before committing to ensure reproducibility
- Use relative imports for project modules
- Store large outputs and artifacts separately
- Link to related notebooks or code when appropriate
